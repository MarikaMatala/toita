## Improving the brand on social media

Pengwin Media 2021 did a great job improving the visual look for WIMMA Lab and for each virtual team. This can be considered as the first step of creating a brand, but there is still more work to be done.

This year Pengwin has a plan to start working on the invisible, the actual "brand" that is left in people's minds. To reach this goal, we have gathered ideas to pursue for brand building. With these pointers in mind, we plan to increase the awareness of WIMMA Lab and start painting a more positive image through social media.


## WIMMA Lab social media platforms

With each week there is a theme that describes that week's social media goal. During the first 3 sprints, our main focus is on marketing Open Doors. 

After that, there is space to start doing social media weeks for each individual team. The purpose of these weeks is to show working in WIMMA Lab in a more free form and show each team in their own unique way. From sprint 5 onward, we plan to film some interviews for Youtube.

The last week is completely reserved for the aftermovie.

### Linkedin

During the first week, we were told make Linkedin profiles and start connecting with visitors and lecturers. Because of these connections, Linkedin is the most important social media platform regarding the future. It is a great place to showcase your work and get it to the hands of a recruiter.

Pengwin Media considers Linkedin to be the facade of WIMMA Lab that is seen by recruiters. Marketing WIMMA Lab's events to reach a huge pool of IT professionals is the desired outcome of using Linkedin. 

Doing posts to Linkedin, Pengwin Media wants to emphasize professionalism and keeping good connections with recruiting companies.

### Youtube

In WIMMA Lab's past, Youtube has been used to showcase assignments and to publish some light funny video content. Considering WIMMA Lab's tiny brand, Youtube is the best place to show what being here is like and why someone would participate.

Pengwin Media's plan is to release VLOGs, interviews and various videos from events. This year we plan to make at least one video per week. 

We also have to figure out how to make our videos reach the next generation of WIMMA Lab.

### Instagram

Instagram plays an important role reaching the next generation of WIMMA Lab, as it is one of the most used social media platforms and gives current participants an easy way to share WIMMA Lab's posts with their own follower base. 

Considering the next WIMMA Lab participants, the content that is published through Instagram should emphasize the true value of being here. We have a plan to contact alumns and let them write their success stories that were sparked by joining WIMMA Lab.

We also plan to copy our Linkedin posts to Instagram.

### Facebook

Facebook should be treated the exact same way as Instagram. On top of that, Facebook events can be used to raise awareness of WIMMA Lab's events.

### Twitter

Twitter is a challenging platform to release content because of it's limitations. Each post has to be cut down to serve the small character limit. With WIMMA Lab's Twitter follower base being as small as it is, Pengwin Media currently does not have much interest in the platform. The plan is to find ways for making WIMMA Lab's Twitter more appealing with unique ways.

## Other external communication platforms

### JAMK

We plan to use JAMK's various channels to market WIMMA Lab and it's event. These channels include JAMK's social media and internal communication.
