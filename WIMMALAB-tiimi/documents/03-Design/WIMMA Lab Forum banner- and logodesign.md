# Forum Banner and Logo

## Background

The Overflow team designed and implemented the Forum website from the beginning. The forum site became part of WIMMA Lab's own site. The team members replaced the Future Factory course with a summer internship (the course had the same assignment in 2022). The team needed a banner and a logo for the forum website, and this documentation goes through the different stages of the banner and logo creation work.


## Logo


### First logo versions



In the logo and banner, we wanted to use the same color scheme as on WIMMA Lab's own pages. We wanted to make the forum page look same. A circle logo was made on the banner; same style as on the homepage, only the word Lab was replaced by the word forum. We also wanted a logo on the top left side of the page. The logo became the WiForum text, Wi was the initial part taken from WIMMA Lab's own logo, to which only the word forum was added at the end. The letter o from the word Forum was changed to WIMMA Lab's "mint green".

First, the shape and layout of the logo was outlined using the pen and paper technique. After that, we tried out how the logo would look like in the realized version. The logos and banner were created with Photoshop. In the background of the banner came a picture of this year's (2022) group playing the Haastix game in Turbini's yard. The image was edited to bluish/greenish; the same color as the banner on WIMMA Lab's own pages. In the banner, I attached a round logo in the middle, which had the word Lab removed and replaced with the word forum.
