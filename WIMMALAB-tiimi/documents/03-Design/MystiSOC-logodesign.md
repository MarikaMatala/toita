# MystiSOC Logo

## Background

The Mysticons team needed a logo for their SOC service (Security operations center).
The idea was to use the already existing team logo and combine it with the service's name. This page goes through the work steps.


## Logo


### First logo versions

Here are preliminary ideas for MystiSOC's logo. The team liked the stylization of the text a lot and we kept it, but we styled and designed the SOC letter O to look like the Mysticons logo; the part of the magnifying glass in the finished logo serves as the logo. I removed the eye in the background from the old logo. The logo was kept black for the most part, the magnifying part was put in the team's official color, purple.

### Second logo versions

When the team and I decided to choose an official logo, we wondered if the logo was missing the so-called "depth". The logo has 3D-style text, so we decided to add a shadow/3D style to the magnifying glass. We kept the colors the same.


### Final logo
