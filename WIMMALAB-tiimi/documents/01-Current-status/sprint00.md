#### 20.05. Friday

Team started to work on social media accounts. We made a [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/wimmalab) for WIMMA Lab. We published our first social media posts. We started to look at the OPF-frame and during the afternoon we had a social engineering lecture which was really interesting. We learned how hackers think and how people can use human instinct against us or get us to buy something we don't really need.
